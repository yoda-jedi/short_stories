Candles are wisping through shadows.
Bell gazes throught the windows, the trees are bending to the winds.
Trees , green but lifeless now dancing with wind.
Winds like howling in the enviroment
Trees like personifying the people.
houses on the streets are more vivid and lifelike.
houses old so old like for eternity.
